# Local Area Network (LAN)
- Let say we have 3 computers and a printer. In order for us to connect the computers and the printer together we will need "Ethernet Switch"
- Ethernet Switch is a physical network device with a bunch of ports on it
- It can be a WiFi as well
- That is the purpose of the local area network
